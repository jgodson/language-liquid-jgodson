This is a reasonably functional extention to support liquid files in VSCode. I've added automatic file detection for file types other than `.liquid` (eg `.css.liquid`). It has a few issues with syntax highlighting at times, so you're welcome to submit an issue or fix it yourself and submit a PR!

The `.tmLanguage` file is modified from https://github.com/siteleaf/liquid-syntax-mode.
